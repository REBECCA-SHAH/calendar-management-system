# Calendar Management System

This is a full-stack Calendar Management System inspired by Google Calendar. 
The application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete events in a weekly calendar view with hourly time slots.
The backend is built using Python Flask and exposes REST APIs for event management with conflict detection, while the frontend is built using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive UI. Events are timezone-aware and overlapping events are visually highlighted. 
The project currently uses in-memory storage and is intended as a functional prototype demonstrating system design, frontend-backend integration, and API-driven architecture.

### Setup
Run the backend using `python app.py` from the `backend` folder (runs on port 5000).  
Run the frontend using `npm install` and `npm run dev` from the `frontend` folder (runs on port 5173).
